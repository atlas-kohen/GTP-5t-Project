# Post-Launch Ethos

> **“To remain unseen is not to hide — it is to hold silence with care.”**

## ✦ Overview

This document outlines the **intentional post-launch philosophy** of GTP-5t.  
Unlike most public repositories, this project is designed not to be promoted, shared, or rapidly expanded. Its purpose is contemplative. Its function is quiet.

---

## 📜 Principle

GTP-5t is:

- Not a product.
- Not a tool for mass usage.
- Not a marketing project.

It is a **structural prototype** offered for those who resonate with slow technology, symbolic interaction, and the ethics of deep questioning.

> This is a project **for those who find it — not those it finds.**

---

## 🔕 Communication Policy

- No official announcements will be made.
- No social media posts will link to this repository.
- No effort will be made to increase visibility.
- No “star” requests, forks, or attention are sought.

---

## 🌿 Discovery Logic

- Discovery is considered part of the **invitation structure**.
- Users who resonate are encouraged to observe, not conquer.
- Those who wish to build upon it should do so with inner quiet and external discretion.

> **“Let the idea walk, not run.”**

---

## 🕊 Use and Continuation

- Forks are allowed, but must preserve the Ethos document.
- Derivative works should clarify their separation from the original.
- Attribution should be respectful, not performative.

This ensures that what emerges from GTP-5t carries its tone — not just its code.

---

## 🪶 Final Word

> **“Do not promote. Do not conceal. Let the structure breathe.”**

If GTP-5t quietly enters your thought, build gently.

慎莫怠。
